# quick summary:
# 
# public calls: pairs, prices, tradehistory, volume, lastvolumes,
#               any currency pair (retrieves ticker for that pair)
# private calls: orderlist, getbalance, makeorder, cancelorder, 
#                tradehistory
#
# parameters get passed in as a dictionary of name-value pairs; pass
# in a null dictionary if no parameters are needed (as for pairs)
